snake game
=====
lang: javascript;<br/>
why: we want to use design recipies from Coursera.org course: "Introduction to systematic program design part 1" and check how they apply here;<br/>

sample configuration:<br/>
var levels = [<br/>
  {<br/>
    draw_X : [2,2,2],<br/>
    set_speed : [5]<br/>
  }<br/>
<br/>
];<br/>
</br>
snake.configure(600,800,20,levels);<br/>
<br/>
Further doc'll be added in the future.
